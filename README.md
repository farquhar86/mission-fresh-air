# Mission Fresh Air

## DESCRIPTION

We are selling fresh Alaskan air by capturing it in mason jars and shipping it to your home to bring awareness to air quality.

Our product aims to address this issue by providing users with a “breath of fresh air” and further awareness of air quality issues.

Currently we have the partners and processes in place to capture and ship fresh Alaskan air. However, unless we are able to buy and ship in bulk, the costs are prohibitively high. Through Kickstarter, we hope to raise the funds necessary to buy and ship the commemorative mason jars of fresh Alaskan air to the contiguous United States.
